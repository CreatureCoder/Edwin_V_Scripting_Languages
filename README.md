<br>
        Passwords must consist of a minimum of two capital letters, two lowercase letters, two digits, and two symbols. <br>
<br>
        When one of the conditions above is not met, the code will call the PasswordException file and store the errors in a <br>
        list.  The list is used for storing the different unmet conditions a password does not meet. <br>
<br>
        End users can choose the pre-created testing grounds or create their own password testing grounds to display if the <br>
        password is not valid and how they want to display the errors. <br>
<br>
        End users will call is_valid function to test if a password is valid or not. <br>
<br>
        End users can deside to activate the DEGUG MODE to see the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and <br>
        symbols the password contains. <br>

<br>
        When one of the conditions above is not met, the code will call the PasswordException file and store the errors in a <br>
        list.  The list is used for storing the different unmet conditions a password does not meet. <br>
<br>
        End users can choose the pre-created testing grounds or create their own password testing grounds to display if the <br>
        password is not valid and how they want to display the errors. <br>
<br>
        End users will call is_valid function to test if a password is valid or not. <br>
